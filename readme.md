# About the app
The Employee Management System project is a software application that allows users to manage
employees in a company. It uses various design patterns such as the Composite pattern for
creating employee hierarchies, the Decorator pattern for adding additional functionality
to employee objects, the Facade pattern for providing a simplified interface to the system,
and the Flyweight pattern for reducing memory usage by sharing common data between objects.
The system allows users to add, remove, and update employee data, perform performance reviews,
and pay employees.
